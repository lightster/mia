Description:
    This will generate a :has_many :through relation for the models you
    name as parameters for the generator.

Example:
    rails generate scaffold_hmt Assembly Part

    This will create:
        app/models/assemblies_part.rb
        db/migrate/<timestamp>_create_assemblies_parts.rb

    this will add to:
        app/models/assembly.rb
        app/models/part.rb

    Optionally, you may use as additional parameter the join model name:
    rails generate scaffold_hmt Assemby Part AssPart

    This will create:
        app/models/ass_part.rb
        db/migrate/<timestamp>_create_ass_parts.rb

    this will add to:
        app/models/assembly.rb
        app/models/part.rb
